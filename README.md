I HAVE IMPLEMENTED HUFFMAN CODING ALGORITHM USING VARIOUS DATA STRUCTURES.
HUFFMAN CODING IS USED TO COMPRESS THE DATA THAT IS IT IS USED TO REDUCE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF BITS USED.
FREQUENCY OF EACH CHARACTER IS RECORDED.
USING ALGORITHM EACH CHARACTER IS ASSIGNED A PARTICULAR CODE.
THE CHARACTER CORRESPONDING TO ITS CODE IS RECORDED IN A TABLE.
FOR NETWORK COMMUNICATION THIS TABLE HAS TO BE TRANSMITTED ALONG WITH THE STREAM OF BITS IN ORDER TO DECODE THE MESSAGE.
